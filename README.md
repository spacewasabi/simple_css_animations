# CSS SLIDESHOW TESTING

## Challenge

Testing CSS animations. Rule : no JavaScript because JavaScript is evil (not really).

## Was it really a challenge

Not really. Animations and keyframes are fairly understandable.

## Projects

Each test is a standalone project in the src folder. Each test comes in a separate folder with a CSS folder and sometimes an img folder.

- infinite_loop_slider : manipulating X axis to move a few pics in a slider

- spin_to_win : making a loader, inspired by waiting a few minutes on the League of Legends loading page.

- fb_loader : making an oldschool loader like the one facebook had. I don't know if they still have it since I don't use Facebook anymore.

- yoyo : a circle that goes down and up. I got the idea this morning when I saw a kid with a yoyo in the metro and honestly it was easier than expected.

- flip : a circle that flips, like a coin. Add some JS maybe and you can do a nice coin-flip. Head or tail?

- swag-shadow : have you seen those old movies with logos that has a cool ass shadow? I tried to do that.

- sonic : a barely recognizable sonic running around a green-hill-themed rounded rectangle

- barrelroll : a button doing a full rotation when it gets focus (aka pressed) and rotates back when losing it. Should have been a input field spinning when RR or ZZ is entered, but why would CSS care about a dynamic "value" property

- pingu : FreeCodeCamp has a lot of great HTML & CSS courses. In one of them, you can learn how to make a nice pingu.

## Next step

I don't know, find a hobby I guess.
Those animations are very small project I might re-use one day (or not).
You can easily find those online but I found most tutorials boring with unnecessary bullshit where the final result can be pretty simple and straight forward.

## No, honestly what is this repo

This repo will allow me to try a few stuff with CSS animations.
Don't expect me to do much styling outside the animations since it's like a lab where I test stuff I'll probably need (or not) in the future. You can contribute, if you think you can teach me a few things (which you probably can).
